Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis – Jewelry E-commerce Dataset

Objective
This task focuses on performing data analysis using **SQL** to extract insights from a jewelry e-commerce dataset. The main goal was to apply core SQL concepts such as data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, subqueries, joins, and optimization techniques.

Tools Used
MySQL Workbench
CSV Dataset: jewelry_cleaned.csv
SQL Queries for analysis and performance

What I Did

Data Preparation
Cleaned the dataset and imported it into MySQL as a table named jewelry_sales.
Created two supporting tables: users and products to perform JOIN operations.

SQL Concepts Implemented
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY for filtering and aggregation
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) to combine data across multiple tables
- Subqueries to filter data based on calculated values
- Aggregate functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT for sales insights
- Views for reusable, simplified query results
- Indexes for performance optimization

Key Analysis Performed
- Total purchases by category
- Average price by gem type
- Top-selling materials
- Products purchased above the average price
- Summary views by category and gem
- User and product insights via JOINs

Files Included
- jewelry_analysis.sql – SQL queries used in the analysis
- jewelry_cleaned.csv – Cleaned dataset
- screenshots – Screenshots of query results from MySQL Workbench

Learnings
This task helped me in strengthning  to manipulate and query structured data using SQL.
